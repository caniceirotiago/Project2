            A Scrum management application is a tool designed to facilitate the implementation of
            the Scrum methodology. It offers features like digital task boards, progress tracking,
            and collaboration tools. These applications enable teams to effectively organize and
            prioritize their tasks, monitor the progress of Sprints, and collaborate in real-time, even when
            team members are geographically dispersed. The application also provides reports and analytics to
            assist in decision-making and the continuous improvement of development processes.
